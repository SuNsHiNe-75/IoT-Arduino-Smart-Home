#### Introduction
This is the final project for the "Assembly Language and Microcomputer Laboratory" course at NSYSU, which I developed in collaboration with three other classmates.

The development tools used were Arduino and related sensors, to implement a smart home system that includes an "Intelligent Trash Can," a "Smart Aquarium," and a "Key Reminder Device."
